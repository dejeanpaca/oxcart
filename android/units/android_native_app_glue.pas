  (**
   * The native activity interface provided by <android/native_activity.h>
   * is based on a set of application-provided callbacks that will be called
   * by the Activity's main thread when certain events occur.
   *
   * This means that each one of this callbacks _should_ _not_ block, or they
   * risk having the system force-close the application. This programming
   * model is direct, lightweight, but constraining.
   *
   * The 'android_native_app_glue' static library is used to provide a different
   * execution model where the application can implement its own main event
   * loop in a different thread instead. Here's how it works:
   *
   * 1/ The application must provide a function named "android_main()" that
   *    will be called when the activity is created, in a new thread that is
   *    distinct from the activity's main thread.
   *
   * 2/ android_main() receives a pointer to a valid "android_app" structure
   *    that contains references to other important objects, e.g. the
   *    ANativeActivity obejct instance the application is running in.
   *
   * 3/ the "android_app" object holds an ALooper instance that already
   *    listens to two important things:
   *
   *      - activity lifecycle events (e.g. "pause", "resume"). See APP_CMD_XXX
   *        declarations below.
   *
   *      - input events coming from the AInputQueue attached to the activity.
   *
   *    Each of these correspond to an ALooper identifier returned by
   *    ALooper_pollOnce with values of LOOPER_ID_MAIN and LOOPER_ID_INPUT,
   *    respectively.
   *
   *    Your application can use the same ALooper to listen to additional
   *    file-descriptors.  They can either be callback based, or with return
   *    identifiers starting with LOOPER_ID_USER.
   *
   * 4/ Whenever you receive a LOOPER_ID_MAIN or LOOPER_ID_INPUT event,
   *    the returned data will point to an android_poll_source structure.  You
   *    can call the process() function on it, and fill in app^.onAppCmd
   *    and app^.onInputEvent to be called for your own processing
   *    of the event.
   *
   *    Alternatively, you can call the low-level functions to read and process
   *    the data directly...  look at the process_cmd() and process_input()
   *    implementations in the glue to see how to do this.
   *
   * See the sample named "native-activity" that comes with the NDK with a
   * full usage example.  Also look at the JavaDoc of NativeActivity.
