# oX engine

`oX` engine, also called the `oxcart` engine. Started in 2007 and went nowhere slowly. Based on the Free Pascal language/compiler.

This is still a major `WORK IN PROGRESS` and may go nowhere, as it is purely a hobby project. I may give up on this altogether. One can never know. A lot of the code may not make sense, or may be outdated (like much of the android stuff).
