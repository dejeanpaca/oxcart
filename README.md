# oX engine

`oX` engine, also called the `oxcart` engine. Started in 2007 and went nowhere slowly. Based on the Free Pascal language/compiler.

This is still a major `WORK IN PROGRESS` and may go nowhere, as it is purely a hobby project. I may give up on this altogether. One can never know. A lot of the code may not make sense, or may be outdated (like much of the android stuff).

## Setup

Look into `setup.md` to learn how to setup and build the engine.

## Units

The units folder contains the extended run-time library.

## 3rdparty

Contains the source for third party libraries used by the project.

## Naming

The engine went through several names in its history, and originally it was called `orcinus-x`, evolved into `orcinusX`, and remained shorthand as `oX` and the original repo was called `oxcart`. As in the `OXCART` project which produced the A-12 and SR-71 spy planes.
